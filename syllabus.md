## Python Neurobootcamp 2018 Syllabus

This course is meant to be a gentle introduction to the Python programming language using data types familar to Neuroscience students, including behaviorial, electrophysiology, and imaging data. Emphasis will be on introducting students to concepts of visualization, data manipulation, and analysis using available Python packages (NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib).

This course is meant to be a prerequisite to the current [Intro to Programming](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/current-students/student-resources/upload/Introduction-to-Programming-Syllabus-SU16.pdf) course and [Bioinformatics Programming and Scripting (BMI 565/665)](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/current-students/student-resources/course-catalog.cfm) available in DMICE.
