    "__What is Python?__  \n",
    "Python is a widely used programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is an *interpreted language*, meaning that it uses a pre-compiled interpreter to read your program code and execute it, one step at a time (similarly to languages like Matlab and IgorPro).  \n",
    "Python emphasizes code readability and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. \n",
    "Writing \"*Pythonian*\" code means writing clear, documented code that other people (and you in six months) will understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this bootcamp is to introduce you to Python by working through some neuro data sets that we selected based on your interests. But before we jump into hands-on analysis, we will go quickly through some basic concepts of Python programming. \n",

    "__What are Python's main strengths and why did we choose it for this course?__ \n",
    "- It is FREE!\n",
    "- Python is becoming the de facto standard programming language in Neuroscience.\n",
    "- There is a lot of support and it is easy to find an answer to your questions just by googling it.\n",
    "- It is designed to be readable (if you write it to be!) \n",

    "This is a Jupyter notebook, a space where you can combine text (this is Markdown) and code. It is an awesome educational tool! The best part is that you will be able to interact with anythnig that is written here, test out code, take notes, and make it your own.\n",
