# Python Neurobootcamp

This repository contains materials for a **Python bootcamp** geared towards graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in neuroscience with little to no experience in programming.

### Format
One week long bootcamp offered in January, 2-3/hrs a day with 15-20 attendants maximum. Ideally this would be led by an experienced teacher that has previously dealt with biological data (and biology majors). This course is intended for researchers who have never programmed before or have little experience with programming. 

### Goals of the bootcamp 
The overall objectives of the course are: 
* build a community of neuroscientists who are committed to help each other and learn together how to code 
* equip students and postodocs with basic knowledge of how to analyze data collected in neuroscience laboratories
* enhance students' and postdocs' appreciation of how acquiring programming skills will help them in their careers within or outside of academia.
Even people that donâ€™t need to know coding, will benefit from knowing the basics skills to be able to communicate with other people in the lab who might code more.
