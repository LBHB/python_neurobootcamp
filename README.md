# Python Neurobootcamp

This repository contains materials for the **Python neuro-bootcamp**, a one-week long class geared towards graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the [Neuroscience Graduate Program at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/academic-programs/neuroscience-graduate-program/) who have little to no experience in programming. The bootcamp was offered in Winter 2018. It consists of a series of 5 Jupyter notebooks, which work through basic principles of data analysis in Python.

While the bootcamp is not run regularly, these materials provide useful preparation for [NEUS 642: Python Programming in Experimental Neuroscience](https://github.com/bburan/NEUS642/blob/master/index.md). We recommend that anyone taking NEUS 642 is comfortable working through these notebooks before taking the course.

The materials were originally hosted on a [JupterHub server](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can find more information about how we set it up [here](server_setup/). However, for independent work, we recommend simply [installing Jupter notebook on your local computer via Anaconda](day-5/Day5_Anaconda_Installation.ipynb).

## Goals of the bootcamp 
The overall objectives of the course are: 
* build a community of neuroscientists who are committed to help each other and learn together how to code; 
* equip students and postdocs with basic knowledge of how to analyze data collected in neuroscience laboratories;
* enhance students' and postdocs' appreciation of how acquiring programming skills will help them in their careers within or outside of academia.

Even people that donâ€™t need to know coding, will benefit from learning the basic skills to be able to communicate with other people in the lab who might code more.

We have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp/blob/master/Code_of_Conduct.md) that everyone who is participating in this course is invited to read carefully. Thank you!

This course was partially funded from a NLM T15 Training Grant supplement: T15-LM007088-23
