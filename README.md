# Python Neurobootcamp

This repository contains materials for the **Python neuro-bootcamp**, a one-week long class geared towards graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the [Neuroscience Graduate Program at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/academic-programs/neuroscience-graduate-program/) who have little to no experience in programming. 

The first iteration of this course, NEUS640, will be held on the second week of January 2018, every day from 9-11:30am. For more information, please read the course's [syllabus](https://github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp/blob/master/NEUS640_syllabus_2018.pdf).

We run this course on the JupyterHub following their [installation guidelines](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can also find more information about how we set it up [here](https://github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp/tree/master/server_setup).

## Goals of the bootcamp 
The overall objectives of the course are: 
* build a community of neuroscientists who are committed to help each other and learn together how to code; 
* equip students and postdocs with basic knowledge of how to analyze data collected in neuroscience laboratories;
* enhance students' and postdocs' appreciation of how acquiring programming skills will help them in their careers within or outside of academia.

Even people that donâ€™t need to know coding, will benefit from learning the basic skills to be able to communicate with other people in the lab who might code more.

We have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp/blob/master/Code_of_Conduct.md) that everyone who is participating in this course is invited to read carefully. Thank you!

This course was partially funded from a NLM T15 Training Grant supplement: T15-LM007088-23
