    "The Anaconda Python distribution is a great way to download and install Python since it also includes many other programs that are popular in scientific computing, such as Jupyter Notebooks, a Python IDE called Spyder, and many of the common Python packages used for scientific computing, among others (a full description of all the packages that are included can be found here https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).\n",
