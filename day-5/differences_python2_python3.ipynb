There are a few key differences between these versions which can cause usability issues (i.e. some code written for python 3 won't run with python 2 without revisions). **This course is used Python Version 3.** However, you may encounter Python version 2, so we would like you to be aware of some of the differences and ways to handle them.  \n",
