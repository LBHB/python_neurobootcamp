    "Pandas is an open source Python library for creating DataFrames and performing data analysis.\n",
    "DataFrames are Python objects composed of Series objects put together to share the same inedex. This will make more sense as soon as we start exploring it. \n",

    "It is relatively user friendly and is excellent for analyzing time-series data, such as physiology traces, over a range of different experimental conditions. Today, we will learn the basics of how to load data from a .csv (spreadsheet) format into a pandas data frame. We will then use pandas to perform some simple analyses and visualization of these data. Days 3 and 4 of this course will dive deeper into the capabilities of Pandas, but today should help get you familiar with some of its basic functionality."
