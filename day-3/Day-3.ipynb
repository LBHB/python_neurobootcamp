    "Today we will analyze patch-clamp data from a single PV neuron in a mouse cortical slice. The experiment we will analyze was performed in current clamp. The experimenter injected 20 different square pulses of current and recorded the voltage response of the neuron to each pulse. Using the data from this experiment, we will create and F-I (frequency-current) curve.\n",
